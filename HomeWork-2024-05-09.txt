1. NodeJS.

Example of reading from file synchronously:
const txtInput = fs.readFileSync('text-to-read.txt','utf8');

The first parameter is the file name, the second is encoding.
The function fs.readFileSync() returns the text from the file.

a) Read from the file chocolate.txt into a variable 
b) Write the text from the variable on the console


2. Use more-events.css and more-events.html

        a) Create function showEvent, which shows in the output  statements like this
           "This is a <event-type> event. Value = <value>"

           The function should show the whole event on the console too.

            For <event-type> use event propety "type",
            for <value> use event.target property "value".

        b) Add listeners that will run this function for the event "input" on userInp,
                for the event "change" on userPass,
                for the event "blur" on birthYearInp

        c) Create function changeColor that exchanges class "blue" by class "red" 
           of the target element if it has class "blue", and vice versa.

        d) Add listeners that will run this function for the event "click" on 
           btn and btn1

3. reduce() inside map(). 

   const numAr = [[-7.65, 1.8, 34.5, -0.44], [1023, 55, -3.45, 1.2, 0.2], 
                  [0.01, 0.03, -0.05, 88.1, 0.2], [2034, 3.01], [166],
                  [-166, -5.4, -76]]

   Go over numAr elements and sum all their numbers. 
   Create new array of these sums.

4.   
const foods = ['pizza','pasta','mac-and-cheese','falafel','hummus','jachnun','sabih']
    const drinks = ['wine','beer','martini','water','wodka','tea','cola']

    Create new array "meals", that will contain objects with properties 
    "food" and "drink" , like [{food: 'pizza',drink: 'wine'},
                               {food: 'pasta',drink: 'beer'},
                               {food: 'mac-and-cheese', drink: 'martini'},
                                ...]
