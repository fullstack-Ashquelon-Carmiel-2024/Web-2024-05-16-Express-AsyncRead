1. Download NodeJS and install Next->Next->Next
   
   Odd number of main version number -> newest, but with bugs
   Even number - stable version, use for production


2. Download Git - for get Git Bash together 
    with it

3. Open terminal in VS Code or 
   Git Bash separate Window and 
    check that you've got NodeJS 
    installed and it's version

$ node -v
v18.20.0

4. create a program, for example, hello.js,
get to it's directory and run it:

$ cd nodejs
$ node hello.js

5. Create directory farm,
   put there inside overview.html and product.html and
   put there inside farm/data/data.json 

   JSON - it's a text, specially formatted to be converted to 
          some object. JavaScript Object Notation - רישום של אובייקט

6. $ cd farm

7. npm - node package manager
 
 It was installed together with NodeJS.

 Initialize the project:

 $ npm init

 This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

Is this OK? (yes)


8. Now we've got new file package.json:


{
  "name": "farm",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "NodeJS Express beginner",
  "main": "farm.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Natalie",
  "license": "ISC"
}
  

  a) It's just text file - we could fix it manually 
  b) If we want to change it - we should save it for backup
